# Cosmic Easter Egg Hunt 🌌🐣✨

Welcome to **The Cosmic Easter Egg Hunt!**  
This game was created as a heartfelt way to share Easter sweetness with my grown sons since I couldn't make a treasure hunt this year, I spent my time with this little game.

## 🚀 Tech Used

This project is a special tribute to family, new traditions, and a little cosmic magic. 💖
